                <p>
                    The Stockade district of Schenectady, NY is positioned next to the Mohawk river.  In the last century, it has flooded 25 times.
                    Floods are sometimes caused by ice jams in the winter, but often occur after severe storms, like Hurricane Irene.  The usual height of
                    the Mohawk river is 212 feet.  The flood of 1913 is classified as a "100 year flood" and peaked at 232.9ft.

                       The National Weather Service classifies major flooding in the Schenectady area when the peak water
                        height is above 224 ft.  At that height water enters the basement of homes in the area and critical
                        electricity-producing infrastructure needs to be protected.  At 226 ft, the height of the water during Hurricane
                        Irene, water enters the first floor of many homes.

                    Since the Lock 7 Dam is now over a century old, independent researchers have looked into how the
                    dam may be affecting the Schenectady flood plain. With 100 years of above-average major flood incidence,
                    the area has suffered billions of dollars in damage.

                <p class="explain-big-text">
                    Unlike modern dams, the Lock 7 dam cannot raise or lower its height to modulate water flow.
                    The NYS Canal Corp and NYS Power Authority have ignored researchers' claims that retrofitting the dam
                    would help mitigate flooding. Additionally, they refused to fund a study that would formally assess
                    the potential impact the dam has on the area.

                <p class="explain-big-text">
                    Upon starting this project, we hoped to illuminate the need for attention to
                    critical infrastructure in the Upstate New York area. The visualizations show
                    that there is a need to retrofit the dam in order to prevent further damage.
                    The New York Power Authority (NYPA) is already in the midst of multi-million dollar
                    projects to improve efficiency on dams including the Lock 7 power plant. Now is the time
                    to advocate for flood protections that the residents of the area deserve.
